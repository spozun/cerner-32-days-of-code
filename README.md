Day 1 - SetTimeouts.js - Slam multiple setTimeouts into your browser-based Javascript faster!

Day 2 - BuildArray.js - Welcome to "w" an under-engineered and over-engineered way to build an array of sequential integers!

Day 3 - threadedTimer.py - It counts, on a thread.

Day 4 - hijack.js - Don't like someone's function?  Just replace it.

Day 5 - timeIt.js - a simple function execution performance timer that can run anywhere.

Day 6 - gitRepoContents.html - this webpage will show you the contents of a user's Git Hub repo, with clickable links.  It defaults to this repo!

Day 7 - simpleThreadChannel.go - 3 threads work together to draw boxes, using a Go Thread Channel.

Day 8 - REPL.lisp - a LISP REPL'er written in LISP.  And it's only one line!

Day 9 - pointers.fortran - some Fortran!  Pointer association to "targets", and it's own address space

Day 10 - NodeExpressHttpServer.js - node server which serves up the contents of the local folder on disk where you ran it from.  Useful for hackathons!
    
    Usage > command line: node NodeExpressHttpServer.js
    Usage > Browser: http://localhost:3000/

Day 11 - walkFileTree.java - recursively walk a file folder and it's contents, returning the absolute path of all contents.

Day 12 - textHighlighter.ts - node function that highlights all instances of a search term in a body of text on the command line.

    "npm install" using textHighlighter-package.json before running this.

Day 13 - codeInjection.rb - playing with Ruby block/yield and eval.  Calls a private funtion that should not be callable.

Day 14 - bensProblem.js - My son Ben asked me last night to solve a logic/number problem while I was sitting at my computer, so I said "let's just write a program for that".  The problem is to use all digits 1-9 each once so that each row and column in the below shape add up to the same number.  There ended up being 96 unique answers.

Day 19 - 10x12_chessboard_architecture.rs - In Rust, initialize the 10x12 chessboard architecture, and the beginnings of find_valid_bishop_moves(), but hit 32 lines and ran out of space.  The 10x12 architecture is designed to make finding legal moves very simple mathematically.

Day 20 - chess_bishop.rs - Complete find_valid_bishop_moves function in it's own module, for my rust chess program.  Works with chess_main.rs.

Day 21 - fun-swift.swift - Fun with Swift: Optional Chaining, and Tuples.

Day 22 - addition.bf - Actual logic in Brain-F, not just character output.  This program adds 2 numbers, which is quite tricky.

Day 24 - engineering_productivity_Ook.Ook - It's OOK!  The sound babboons make, and also an esoteric programming langauge!
