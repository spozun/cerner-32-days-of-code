Cerner 32 days of code, 32 lines or less.

Day 1 - SetTimeouts.js - A sad way to slam multiple setTimeouts into your browser-based Javascript faster!

Day 2 - BuildArray.js - Welcome to "w" an under-engineered and over-engineered way to build an array of sequential integers!

Day 3 - threadedTimer.py - It counts, on a thread.

Day 4 - hijack.js - Don't like someone's function?  Just replace it.

Day 5 - timeIt.js - a simple function execution performance timer that can run anywhere.

Day 6 - gitRepoContents.html - this webpage will show you the contents of a user's Git Hub repo, with clickable links.  It defaults to this repo!

Day 7 - simpleThreadChannel.go - 3 threads work together to draw boxes, using a Go Thread Channel.

Day 8 - REPL.lisp - a LISP REPL'er written in LISP.  And it's only one line!

Day 9 - pointers.fortran - some Fortran!  Pointer association to "targets", and it's own address space
