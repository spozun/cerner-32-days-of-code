Day 14 - bensProblem.js - My son Ben asked me last night to solve a logic/number problem while I was sitting at my computer, so I said "let's just write a program for that".  The problem is to use all digits 1-9 each once so that each row and column in the below shape add up to the same number.  There ended up being 96 unique answers.
